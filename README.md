# prime.py
## Introduction
This is my python project which can check whether a number is prime and give you the nth prime number.
## Uses
You can run this programme, or put it in the same folder as your other python files, and import it like this (this also lists the functions):<br/>
``import prime``<br/>
``prime.isprime(x)``<br/>
``prime.prime(x)``<br/>
``prime.ask()``<br/>
## How to use imported finctions
``prime.isprime(x)`` checks if x is prime.<br/>
``prime.prime(x)`` gets the xth prime number.<br/>
``prime.ask()`` runs the programme on your programme.
